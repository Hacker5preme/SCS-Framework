# SCS - Framework 
##### Version 0.1
### SCS - Framework is an open source, source code scanning framework, which aims to make code more secure by finding security vulnerabilities through statical code analysis.

## The Idea:
The Idea of SCS-Framework is to provide a free, open source statical code analysis tool for finding vulnerabilities in source code. 
SCS-Framework will be structured inspired by the metasploit-framework. As more and more vulnerable code snippets will be added, 
some of them hopefully by other Security Researchers, SCS-Framework will be a powerful tool for both Blue and Red Teaming.
