# SourceCodeScanning Framework

## Idea:
#### The idea of the SourceCodeScanning Framework is to provide a SourceCodeScanning Framework, which analyzes files and directories statically for known vulnerable code snippets, which are linked to published exploits and vulnerabilities. Let's make code safer !

## Usage:

## Vulnerability Format:
#### For Contribution:
- Beginning of the vulnerable Code Snippet | String, which needs to be present in the snippet | End of the snippet
- Vulnerability description
- Condition under the code snippet is vulnerable and exploitable
- Links to exploits, vulnerabilities and blogposts
- Severity: High (3), Medium (2), Low (1)
- Nametag
